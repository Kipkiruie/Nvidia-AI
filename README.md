ðŸ’¡PROMPT From the chart, can you explain the trend of popularity of programming languages since 2014? and what impact could contribute to a certain programming language popularity trend?
REPLY
The chart shows the popularity of programming languages from 2014 to 2024. The trend is that Python has been steadily increasing in popularity, while C++ has been decreasing. JavaScript has remained relatively stable, with a slight increase. Java has also experienced a steady increase, while C# has decreased slightly. PHP has remained relatively stable â€¦â€¦â€¦
